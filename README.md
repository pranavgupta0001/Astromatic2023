# AI-driven Astrophysical Parameter Inference

This repository contains the code and resources for the project focused on inferring cosmological parameters using advanced machine learning techniques.


## Overview

The project utilizes a Score-based diffusion model and U-Net architecture to infer cosmological parameters and map dark matter distributions. The primary goal is to leverage machine learning to address challenges in astrophysics, particularly in the domain of cosmological parameter estimation.

## Techniques

### Score-based Diffusion Model and U-Net Architecture
Utilized for inferring cosmological parameters from 2D gas density maps and mapping dark matter distributions.

### Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN)
Implemented to provide a probabilistic framework for neural networks, allowing for the measurement of uncertainty in predictions.

### Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
Used in conjunction with BNN to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters, further enhancing the uncertainty quantification.


## Data
The project utilizes data from the CAMELS suite of simulations.
